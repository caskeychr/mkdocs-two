# MkDocs - Two

This is submodule 2 included into mkdocs through the git submodule command.

These components are integrated directly into MkDocs and filtered as additional pages but this component could also serve as a standalone site on it's own.

For demo purposes, this module contains two markdown pages:

| Page | Description                 |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| Home | Current page you're viewing |
| Info | Description of component    |
